# fcc-number-guessing-game
Final project from freecodecamp in order to put in practice the knowledge acquired during the course(git, sql and bash).
Basically in this project I create a database with a users table (with user_id, username,  number_games and best_game)
where user's game info is store and a script to display the game, it is 'guess the number', the user has to guess the random
number that the script generate from 1 to 100.
